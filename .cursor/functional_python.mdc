- Write **pure, stateless functions** wherever feasible; avoid mutation and rely on return values for state propagation.
- Compose behaviour with `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `itertools`, and `functools.partial` rather than imperatively iterating.
- Follow **PEP 8** for naming, spacing, and 88-column line length (run `black` pre-commit).:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Provide **Google-style docstrings** that satisfy **PEP 257** (1-line summary + Args/Returns/Examples).:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Keep functions â‰¤ 40 LOC; defer shared helpers to `utils/`.
- Type-annotate all public APIs and run `mypy --strict`.
- Prefer `dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)` for value objects.
- Treat warnings as errors; configure `ruff` (or `flake8`) with `--select E,F,I,W,C90` for linting.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Include property-based tests with `hypothesis` plus standard `pytest` unit tests.
