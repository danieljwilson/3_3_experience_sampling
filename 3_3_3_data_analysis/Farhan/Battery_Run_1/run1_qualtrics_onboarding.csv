For example, a question asked if we have goals when it comes to the relationship between us and our partner. Many people don't currently have a partner but perhaps would like to get married in the future. Here they currently don't have specific goals but may have for the future. The questions also asked about alcohol/drug consumption and our goals related to that. Many people do not indulge in alcohol and drugs because it's against their religious beliefs so it was somewhat difficult to figure out what answer to put for those. Please create questions and clarifications that accommodate people of other backgrounds, Thank you.
